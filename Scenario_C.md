Hi Farhan,

Thank you for reaching out and explaining the details of your situation to us. We hope you are feeling better. The consequences of the current pandemic are also familiar to us and we do acknowledge that the technical difficulties were unaccounted for. Thus, we are willing to give you an additional extension of 48 hours to complete the missing assignment.

For the technical issue, you can contact technical support by reaching out through the [Discussion System](https://discussions.codepath.com/). We are hoping that the extension will be enough time to resolve the technical issue and finish the assignment. Do contact us again if further complications arise.

All the best,

CodePath.org Team
