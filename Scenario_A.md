Hi Raju,

We have checked the records regarding your attendance in your most recent CodePath iOS Course class. It shows that you were able to attend the class, as you have said, and that you stayed for 10 minutes.

Please be reminded that staying for at least half of the class duration is required to be considered present for it. The class in question lasts for an hour, and, thus, requires students to stay for at least 30 minutes. That is why you have been marked as "Absent".

We understand that keeping up with different class schedules may be confusing at times. In such cases, students can always check upcoming classes in their Google Calendars.

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
