Hi Raju,

We have checked the records regarding your attendance in the November 3 CodePath iOS Course class. It showed that you attended, as you have said, and that you stayed for 10 minutes.

Please be reminded that staying for at least half of the class duration is required to be marked "Present" for it. The class in question lasts for an hour, and thus requires students to stay for at least 30 minutes. That is why the 10 minute attendance was still considered an absence.

We understand that keeping up with different class schedules may be confusing at times. In such cases, you can check your Google Calendar for the details of your upcoming classes.

All the best,

CodePath.org Team
