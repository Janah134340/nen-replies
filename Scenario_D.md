Hi Rachondas,

Congratulations on getting accepted as an intern at Microsoft!

We will immediately process your withdrawal request and move you to being an observer. As an observer, you will still have lifetime access to the course material. This means that you can keep studying at your own pace without having to worry about due dates and other expectations from the course.

If you would like to receive updates on upcoming courses and events, you can join our mailing list by filling out [this](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) form.

All the best,  
CodePath.org Team
