Hi Pia,

We appreciate your eagerness to stay in the CodePath Cybersecurity course and have seen your efforts to keep up with its requirements. However, attendance is a significant aspect of our educational model and [our policy](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19) dictates that students who have exceeded 3 absences for a course must be withdrawn from it.

The course does allow reconsideration for students under extenuating circumstances as stated [here](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/cybersecurity_university/policies_remote_fall19). In your case, we acknowledge that, on top of the CodePath Cybersecurity course, you have work and a full load of other classes to focus on. It seems that the situation has been proven to be overwhelming and we are concerned that the circumstances will continue to overwork you. Thus, we found it best to postpone your commitment to the course.

We will gladly welcome you to the same course in the next semester once you have less load and better availability. In the meantime, you can continue watching the course's session recordings and access other [Cybersecurity resources online](http://guides.codepath.com/cybersecurity/Cybersecurity-Resources#cybersecurity-resources) in your own time.

All the best,

CodePath.org Team
